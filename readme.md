# Prode Football Project

## Description

I developed this personal project with the aim of creating a web application from scratch and completing it to provide users with a satisfying experience. Through this project, I gained valuable experience and learning in implementing web applications.

The project involved creating a "prode" system for football, where participants predict the outcomes of matches in a specific competition, such as a tournament or a league. Players select the winning teams or draws and accumulate points for correct predictions. At the end of the event, winners are determined based on their accumulated scores.

## Technology Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- Node.js and the Express framework for the API, which connected with a football data provider API for different championships, such as the 2022 World Cup.
- Next.js for the user-facing web interface, providing a dynamic experience throughout.
- MongoDB as the database.

## Implemented Features

### Predictions

1. Users can make predictions for matches.
2. After matches are completed, users can view the predictions of other players in a common tournament.
3. Users can follow real-time results of ongoing match predictions.
4. Users can edit their predictions before a match begins and lock them once the match has started.

### Tournaments

1. Private and public tournaments are implemented.
2. Players are ranked based on their accumulated accuracy score.
3. Users can send requests to join a private tournament.
4. Users can create and manage their tournaments.
5. Player profile view within the tournament, displaying detailed statistics like the number of perfect predictions, accurate predictions, correct goal differentials, and their highest streak of correct predictions.
6. Users can choose their candidate team.

## Deployment

The application was deployed on Google Cloud Platform.
